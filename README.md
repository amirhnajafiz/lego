# LEGO

A curated collection of reusable Golang libraries and packages.

This repository serves as a centralized catalogue for Go code, primarily organized within the `pkg` directory. Many of these libraries are commonly required across multiple projects, and consolidating them here reduces duplication and streamlines development. By using this module, you can easily integrate well-tested, shared components into your own Go applications. LEGO
